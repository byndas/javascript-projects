// 1) Use split to convert the strings into four cabinet arrays
//    Alphabetize the contents of each cabinet

// 2) cargoHold = [] & add the cabinet arrays to it
//    Log cargoHold to verify its structure

// 3) Query the user to select a cabinet (0 - 3) in the cargoHold

// 4) Use bracket notation & a template literal to display contents of selected cabinet
//    If user entered invalid number, log error message

// 5) Modify code to query user for BOTH a cabinet in cargoHold AND a particular item
//    Use .includes() to check if cabinet contains selected item
//    then log “Cabinet ____ DOES/DOES NOT contain ____.”
